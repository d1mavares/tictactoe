# TicTacToe
Using Minimax, implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally. AI50 course project for tictactoe (week 0, project 1)

There are two main files in this project: runner.py and tictactoe.py. tictactoe.py contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for making optimal moves.You should be able to run python runner.py to play against your AI!
We’ve chosen to represent the board as a list of three lists (representing the three rows of the board), where each internal list contains three values that are either X, O, or EMPTY.
