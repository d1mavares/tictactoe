Tic-Tac-Toe

ai50 course project for tictactoe (week 0, project 1)

Using Minimax, implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

There are two main files in this project: runner.py and tictactoe.py. tictactoe.py contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for making optimal moves.You should be able to run python runner.py to play against your AI! Weâ€™ve chosen to represent the board as a list of three lists (representing the three rows of the board), where each internal list contains three values that are either X, O, or EMPTY.
